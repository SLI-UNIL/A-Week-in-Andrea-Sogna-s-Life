You oughta know that YOU ARE THE 11th! And that, therefore, 10 siblings are eagerly waiting for you to join them in the shelves, cardboard boxes, or wherever I lovingly and cautiously thr...stored them.","\n","^Now, with no further ado, my dear but still inexperienced Diary, I'll tell you two or three basic things about myself. I'm Andrea Sogna, 22 years old, student at the University of Geneva (third and last year of BA in French & History of Art), no family, or as if: no siblings, no relatives, and terrible parents; 'Don't study arts nor philosophy, find yourself a real job!' (the kind of \"real job\" you find in business schools LOL), 'A child should have a mother and a father' (too bad I'm gay), 'There are too many foreigners' (said my only freshly Swiss-naturalized dad, but I guess his and theirs (my mom is no better) wonderful values are international...), etc…","\n","^See, better without family, right? Especially since I managed to leave our 35 m2-living-hell-flat and established myself in a nice student room! Or at least it's what I have to tell myself... Let's say if I lived in Hell, now I live in the antechamber of Hell, or rather in a long forgotten torture chamber, \"furnished\" with something that somehow looks like a bed (but definitely feels not like one), an all-purposed piece of furniture, a wardrobe made of two cardboard boxes, a sink (I'd rather die than drink the murky and muddy water that comes out of it) and a 19th century vintage gas stove. Last but not least, the sanitary facilities are common, and even though I've barely seen the other users I know they exist, since it's always dirtier before I arrive than after I leave...","\n","^ANYWAY, I'll stop for tonight! It's already late and I wake up early tomorrow, so I better go to bed quickly! Dear new Diary, I wish us a good night, and see you tomorrow!","\n","ev","str","^<h3> October 17, Monday <h3>","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"Monday"},{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Monday":[["^<h3> October 17, Monday <h3>","\n","^<h3> 2022 <h3>","\n","^Dear Diary,","\n","^As I woke up this morning, I realized it was raining hard outside.","\n",["ev",{"^->":"Monday.0.8.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":18},{"s":["^Still, I decided to courageously go to the University by bike, hoping the rain would stop ","<>",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],["ev",{"^->":"Monday.0.9.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-1","flg":18},{"s":["^So, I decided to use public transportation",{"->":"$r","var":true},null]}],{"c-0":["ev",{"^->":"Monday.0.c-0.$r2"},"/ev",{"temp=":"$r"},{"->":".^.^.8.s"},[{"#n":"$r2"}],"\n","ev",{"VAR?":"Mood"},10,"-",{"VAR=":"Mood","re":true},"/ev","ev",{"VAR?":"Mood"},0,"<","/ev",[{"->":".^.b","c":true},{"b":["\n",{"->":"BadMood"},{"->":".^.^.^.19"},null]}],"nop","\n","^(I had no hope).","\n","^I arrived completely soaked and, since I took extra care on the road because of the rain, almost late.
